Counter Intelligence Foreign Adversarial Detector Tool (FADT) Using Mafia Game Dynamics

Project Overview

Develop an AI-driven system (Counter Intelligence Foreign Adversarial Detector Tool - FADT) to identify and analyze potential foreign adversarial influences within corporate and institutional environments, utilizing behavioral patterns observed in the party game Mafia.

Background
Deception detection is crucial in corporate security and counter-intelligence
The party game Mafia provides a controlled environment to study deceptive behaviors
AI and machine learning offer powerful tools for pattern recognition and analysis

Objectives
Develop FADT system based on Mafia game dynamics for corporate counter-intelligence
Validate effectiveness of FADT in simulated and real-world business environments
Establish best practices for ethical implementation of game-based counter-intelligence tools

Methodology
Mafia Game Adaptation

Setting: Simulated corporate environment with suspected insider threats
REAL DATA: Targeted Datasets from actual cases of detected and suspected espionage to train the model. 
Roles: Employees (civilians) and Foreign Agents (spies)
Gameplay: Foreign Agents attempt to complete covert missions while avoiding detection
Missions: Gather sensitive information, identify key personnel or resources
Interaction: Professional communication, negotiations, and observations
Detection: Regular security audits (voting) to identify potential threats

Data Collection

Sources: Recorded game sessions, player interactions, decision-making processes
Include real-world corporate espionage case studies for comparison
Ensure legal and ethical compliance in data gathering

AI Model Development

Use NLP, network analysis, anomaly detection based on Mafia game data
Train on patterns of deception and detection observed in game sessions
Implement supervised learning techniques tailored to corporate threat detection

System Implementation

Create secure dashboard for authorized corporate security personnel
Set up real-time monitoring and alerts based on learned deceptive patterns
Establish investigation protocols aligned with game-derived insights

Testing and Validation

Conduct pilot studies with partner corporations using adapted Mafia game scenarios
Assess accuracy and reliability in detecting simulated foreign adversarial influences
Iterate based on feedback from corporate security experts and game results

Ethical Considerations

Form ethics review board with expertise in gaming, psychology, and corporate security
Develop guidelines for ethical use of game-derived data in real-world applications
Implement safeguards against misuse of the system and protect player privacy

Expected Outcomes

Functional FADT system trained on Mafia game dynamics for corporate use
Insights into deceptive behaviors transferable to real-world corporate settings
Novel approach to corporate security training using game-based simulations

Conclusion
This project aims to leverage the rich behavioral data from Mafia-style games to enhance counter-intelligence capabilities in corporate and institutional settings, offering a unique and engaging approach to security training and threat detection.

Secure partnerships with corporations willing to participate in game-based training
Assemble research team with expertise in game theory, psychology, and AI
Begin game adaptation and data collection process
