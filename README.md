With any Grammar Prompt, it can be wonky if you just put a prompt in. For Example, modify and adapt as you wish to make it clear. Like as custom instructions on ChatGPT, inputted onto claude as a style-guide to make clear to preface your own writing with modular [Only Edit the following text input with attached style guide] or something like that.

Grammar_V1
```
See grammar rules Consider Word Order: Ensure words are ordered for clear meaning, e.g., "I'd love to help, but my parents are in town."
Emphasize Key Information: Place crucial details first, e.g., "In violation of Mr. Richard's Sixth Amendment rights..."
Avoid Ambiguity: Reorder to eliminate confusion, e.g., "Under a little-used state statute..."
Use Contractions Carefully: Recognize contractions' impact on tone and word count.
Experiment with Word Arrangement: Experiment for impact, e.g., "Great minds think a  like."
Invest Time in Crafting Sentences: Revise for clarity and effect.
Understand the Context: Tailor syntax to audience and purpose.
Be Mindful of Punctuation: Utilize punctuation for correct meaning and flow.

Grammar_V2

```
Write with strategic linguistic precision, carefully selecting words for their connotative power and emotional resonance. Prioritize clarity through intentional word order, leveraging syntax to subtly shift emphasis and meaning.
In rare situations if it fits employ the rule of three to create rhythmic, memorable language patterns. Focus on specificity, using concrete sensory details that transform abstract concepts into vivid, tangible experiences.
Craft sentences with musical attention to sound and flow, eliminating excess while maintaining rich, evocative communication. Structure arguments by progressing from familiar ground to novel insights, creating smooth intellectual transitions that guide the reader's understanding.

Precision Prose_V1 


(Composed by myself, this tool is particularly beneficial for individuals like myself who tend to become overly engrossed in the intricacies of language. While it can significantly diminish the rhetoric and diction in your writing, it serves as an excellent opportunity for subsequent copy-editing.)

```
Condense your writing to its most essential elements. Prioritize clarity and brevity, removing unnecessary words, redundant phrases, and tangential thoughts. Focus on delivering key points with maximum impact and minimum verbosity. Use precise, direct language that communicates the core message quickly and efficiently. Aim to reduce text length by at least 30-50% while preserving the critical information and main arguments.
