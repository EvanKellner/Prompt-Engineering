# Stock Forecasting Application Project Overview

## 1. Project Description
Develop a Python-based stock forecasting application that allows users to make predictions on stock price movements for a dataset of 100 stocks. The application will track prediction accuracy using the Brier Score and provide long-term performance analysis.

## 2. Key Features
- Manage a dataset of 100 stocks (TICKER, Company Name)
- Allow users to enter predictions for stock price movements
- Calculate and track prediction accuracy using Brier Score

- Intitial Iteration (V.1) will just SAVE a text file or a CSV with the Stock Ticker,

1. Stock Ticker shows, Current Price Shows.
2. Enter Prediction (Price Raises or Lowers in X(1,3,12) months. 
2.A "Theres a 70% chance that APPL will rise in next week. .7 
3. After specified time, user uploads their original .txt. Dataset with current prices calculates brier score .

GAMIFICATION IDEA:
1/5/10 minute increment to research the stock to make an educated guess short hand. 


LONG TERM GOAL - TRAIN PROGRAM TO FORECAST STOCK PRICES
- Data Trained with random historic stock price, (last 15 or so years)
- Educated Guess based on information dated BEFORE the time period to predict stock price. datastreams of content related to stock analysis
- Program with Machine Learning finds out whether or not that specific information led to a correct or non-correct prediction, training model. 

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Data Management
- Use pandas DataFrames to store and manipulate stock data and predictions
- Implement data structures to associate predictions with stocks and timestamps

### 3.2 Brier Score Calculation
The Brier Score measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. For stock price predictions:

1. For each prediction:
   - Prediction (ft): Probability assigned to the stock rising (e.g., 0.7 for 70% chance of rising)
   - Outcome (ot): 1 if the stock price rose, 0 if it fell or remained the same

2. Calculate the Brier Score using the formula:
   BS = (1/N) * Î£(ft - ot)^2
   Where N is the total number of predictions

3. Implementation in Python:
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_brier_score(predictions, outcomes):
    return np.mean((predictions - outcomes) ** 2)
```

### 3.3 Long-term Tracking
To track performance over time:

1. Store each prediction with:
   - Stock ticker
   - Prediction timestamp
   - Prediction probability
   - Actual outcome
   - Calculated Brier Score

2. Implement functions to analyze performance:
   - Calculate rolling Brier Score (e.g., last 30 days, last 100 predictions)
   - Compare performance across different stocks or sectors
   - Track improvement over time

Example Python structure:
```python
import pandas as pd

class PredictionTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.predictions = pd.DataFrame(columns=['Ticker', 'Timestamp', 'Prediction', 'Outcome', 'BrierScore'])

    def add_prediction(self, ticker, timestamp, prediction, outcome):
        brier_score = (prediction - outcome) ** 2
        new_row = pd.DataFrame({'Ticker': [ticker], 'Timestamp': [timestamp], 
                                'Prediction': [prediction], 'Outcome': [outcome], 
                                'BrierScore': [brier_score]})
        self.predictions = pd.concat([self.predictions, new_row], ignore_index=True)

    def get_rolling_brier_score(self, window=30):
        return self.predictions['BrierScore'].rolling(window=window).mean()

    def get_performance_by_stock(self):
        return self.predictions.groupby('Ticker')['BrierScore'].mean()
```

## 4. Key Components

### 4.1 Data Input and Storage
- Implement functions to input and update stock data
- Create a system for users to enter predictions

### 4.2 Prediction Evaluation
- Develop a mechanism to compare predictions against actual stock performance
- Implement the Brier Score calculation

### 4.3 Performance Analysis
- Create functions for various performance metrics (e.g., accuracy over time, performance by stock)
- Implement data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn

### 4.4 User Interface
- Develop a command-line interface for interacting with the application
- Consider future expansion to a graphical interface using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt

## 5. Future Enhancements
- Implement machine learning models for automated predictions
- Expand the stock dataset beyond 100 stocks
- Develop a web-based interface for broader accessibility
- Integrate real-time stock data feeds

## 6. Next Steps
1. Set up the Python development environment
2. Implement the core data structures and Brier Score calculation
3. Develop the basic command-line interface
4. Begin testing with a small subset of stocks
5. Gradually expand functionality and test with the full dataset
