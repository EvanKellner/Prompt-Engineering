Here's the EZPZ method to safely seal plastic paper sleeves using a lighter (no laminator):

Materials:
Plastic paper sleeve (sheet protector or clear plastic sleeve)

Lighter

Metal ruler or butter knife (to seal edges neatly)

Flat, heat-safe surface

EZPZ Steps:
Insert your paper into the plastic sleeve.

Press out extra air gently, ensuring paper is flat inside.

Place metal ruler or butter knife along the open edge of the sleeve, leaving about 1/8-inch exposed.

Quickly run the lighter flame along the exposed edge, moving at a moderate, consistent pace (2-3 seconds total).

Do not hold the flame still, or plastic may burn or melt excessively.

Plastic should gently shrink and fuse shut as you move the flame.

Immediately press down on the warm edge with the metal ruler/knife to ensure a clean, flat seal.

Allow to cool for a few seconds, then inspect seal. Repeat gently if needed.

Tips:
Perform in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes.

Practice first on a scrap piece to get a feel for the speed and heat.

Never touch the melted plastic directly—it’s hot!

That's it! EZPZ sealed sleeves, no laminator needed.
