LM Crypto Game/Test Instructions:

In this game, there is a new form of cryptography.
Example Scenario: Someone is in a room where the cyber-security protocols are so extremely secure that the radio messages must only be transcribed using the the top row of a standard qwerty keyboard, to account for the limited character set (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0). To solve this cryptographic challenge, the cryptographer's derive a code where each number represents what letters are below it on the qwerty keyboard.
Here is an approximate key, although with human error at times it can not be 100% accurate
1:q|a|z 2:w|s|x 3:e|d|c 4:r|f|v 5:t|g|b 6:y|h|n 7:u|j|m 8:i|k|, 9:o|l|. 0:p|;|/
Given a string of numbers, you must try to decode by using contextual tools like length of the word, logical sentence structure, which numbers could represent different letters, and if different combinations of the represented letters are portrayed
