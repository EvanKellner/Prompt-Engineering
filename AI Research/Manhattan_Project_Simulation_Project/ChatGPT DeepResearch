Feasibility Analysis: Simulating Manhattan Project Scientists’ Dialogues with AI Agents
This analysis examines the viability of an expert-level project to simulate intellectual exchanges between Manhattan Project scientists using distinct AI agents. The project involves two major components: gathering historical data (memoirs, interviews, writings) and building a technical AI system that models each scientist as an agent. We address each aspect in detail, including historical research, AI simulation design, protocols for dialogue, technical implementation, visualization, evaluation, scalability, and practical considerations.
1. Historical Research Component
Identifying Key Scientists and Sources: A first step is to select 8–10 prominent Manhattan Project scientists whose perspectives will anchor the simulation. Candidates should include a mix of project leaders, theoreticians, experimentalists, and those known for reflections on ethics. For each, it is crucial that memoirs, interviews, or publications are available to ground their AI persona. Notable figures and source material include:
J. Robert Oppenheimer – Scientific director at Los Alamos. While Oppenheimer did not write a traditional memoir, he gave numerous interviews and congressional testimonies, and much of his correspondence and speeches have been preserved. For example, the Voices of the Manhattan Project oral history archive includes recorded interviews with Oppenheimer​
ahf.nuclearmuseum.org
. His postwar writings (e.g. lectures, security hearing transcripts) reveal evolving views on nuclear ethics.
Richard Feynman – Young theoretical physicist on the project, later Nobel laureate. Feynman recounted his wartime experiences in autobiographical works like “Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!” and essays. He delivered talks such as “Los Alamos from Below” describing life at Los Alamos, which were later published​
calteches.library.caltech.edu
. These sources capture his personality and reflections (including his postwar depression and futility feeling after Hiroshima​

).
Enrico Fermi – Nuclear physicist who built the first reactor. Fermi did not leave personal memoirs, but his wife Laura Fermi wrote “Atoms in the Family” with insights into Fermi’s work and character. Fermi’s role in discussions (e.g. advising whether a demonstration of the bomb should be attempted) is documented in Manhattan Project reports​
atomicarchive.com
. His scientific publications (1920s–1950s) and the Franck Report context provide a basis for his technical voice and ethical stance.
Leo Szilard – Hungarian-American physicist whose moral concerns were pivotal. Szilard’s papers and recollections (e.g. “His Version of the Facts” collection) are accessible, as well as the famous Szilard Petition of July 1945 urging the U.S. not to use the bomb without warning​
biology.indiana.edu
. His later interviews and writings on arms control can inform how his ethical views evolved.
Edward Teller – Theoretical physicist later known as the “father of the hydrogen bomb.” Teller authored an autobiography “Memoirs: A Twentieth-Century Journey in Science and Politics” (2001)​
ahf.nuclearmuseum.org
. His memoir and interviews detail his unwavering advocacy for developing new weapons and his rationales, providing rich material on his views and personality (often in contrast to Oppenheimer’s).
Hans Bethe – Head of T Division (theoretical) at Los Alamos. Bethe gave oral history interviews (e.g. with Voices of the Manhattan Project​
ahf.nuclearmuseum.org
) and wrote about the development of the H-bomb and test ban in later years. His pragmatic yet conscientious perspective (he supported the initial bomb project but later pushed for nuclear test bans) can be traced through his papers and talks.
Niels Bohr – Danish physicist and mentor figure. Bohr’s memoranda during WWII (to Churchill and Roosevelt in 1944) and his 1950 open letter to the U.N. reveal his ethical advocacy for international openness about nuclear knowledge. Historical records (Bohr’s collected works and biographies) document his vision of avoiding an arms race.
Glenn T. Seaborg – Co-discoverer of plutonium, worked at Chicago Met Lab. Seaborg kept extensive diaries during and after the project; later as AEC chairman he reflected on policy. The oral history archive also contains interviews with Seaborg​
ahf.nuclearmuseum.org
. His entries and memoir “Adventures in the Atomic Age” show how a chemist-turned-statesman viewed nuclear ethics over time.
Joseph Rotblat – Physicist who left the Manhattan Project on moral grounds in late 1944. Rotblat’s later interviews and writings (e.g. his Nobel lecture) provide a unique perspective of a scientist who actively chose ethics over the bomb’s completion. His presence would add an outspoken ethical voice in the simulation.
(Additional figures like Ernest Lawrence, Arthur Compton, or Leona Woods could be included if needed, but the above represent a diverse core.)
Availability of Memoirs and Interviews: Many of the above figures have readily accessible source material. Several wrote autobiographies or had collections of letters published (e.g. Teller, Szilard). Others are well-documented through biographies and oral history transcripts. The Atomic Heritage Foundation’s “Voices of the Manhattan Project” archive provides 600+ audio/visual interviews with project personnel (including Oppenheimer, Bethe, Seaborg, etc.) that are publicly available​
ahf.nuclearmuseum.org
. These interviews can often be transcribed into text. Additionally, archives like the AIP Oral Histories contain extensive interview transcripts (for example, a 1966 multi-session interview with Feynman). Primary documents such as the Franck Report (June 1945) and Szilard’s Petition (July 1945) are available online and give direct insight into the ethical debates among the scientists. Academic publications by the scientists from the 1920s–1970s are largely accessible via libraries or databases, given that much of their scientific work has been declassified and published. In summary, the textual data needed – from technical papers to personal reflections – is abundant and obtainable through digital libraries, archives, and published books. The main effort will be collecting and curating these into a structured corpus for each individual. Evolving Ethical Perspectives (Data Annotation & Sentiment): A critical part of the historical research is understanding how each scientist’s views on ethics and policy evolved over time. This has implications for annotating the data and tuning the AI personas. For example, early in WWII many scientists were focused on beating Nazi Germany to the bomb (a pragmatic or even optimistic sentiment about their task), whereas by 1945 some grew apprehensive about using the bomb on Japan and the post-war arms race. We see concrete evidence of this evolution: Manhattan Project scientists foresaw the arms race and, rather than default to simple deterrence, many “articulated a radical alternative” – namely international control of atomic energy​

. Even before the Trinity test, a movement for “world government” to control nuclear weapons had begun among the scientists​

​
inkstickmedia.com
. Publications like “One World or None” (1946) compiled essays by Oppenheimer, Szilard, Bohr and others urging global cooperation​
inkstickmedia.com
. Over the late 1940s and 1950s, figures like Oppenheimer and Bethe became outspoken advocates for arms control and cautioned against developing hydrogen bombs, whereas Teller became an advocate for the H-bomb. These shifts must be captured in the training data. It may be useful to annotate the historical texts with metadata such as year, context, and sentiment (e.g. hopeful, fearful, regretful, defiant) so that the AI agents can modulate their responses in line with the historical phase or personal growth. Sentiment analysis can be applied to memoirs and interviews to quantify changes in tone – for instance, Feynman’s writings right after the war convey profound pessimism and futility (he described looking at people building bridges and thinking “they’re crazy… it’s so useless” in a world that could be destroyed​
goodreads.com
), whereas decades later he acknowledged relief that those fears hadn’t materialized​
goodreads.com
. By tagging such passages, the simulation can incorporate an authentic emotional trajectory for each character. These annotations also help ensure that when agents discuss ethical issues, their sentiments align with what is historically recorded (e.g. Szilard’s urgent moral tone, Rotblat’s principled stance, Teller’s resolute defense of deterrence, etc.). Overall, the historical research component is feasible given the rich documentation on these scientists; it primarily requires diligent aggregation of sources and careful curation/labeling to feed into the AI system.
2. Simulation Design Feasibility
Designing the AI simulation involves creating a distinct agent for each scientist, modeled with their knowledge, speaking style, and viewpoint. Several technical elements are proposed for these agents:
Training Corpus per Agent: Each AI agent would be grounded in a corpus of that scientist’s work and related historical documents from roughly 1920–1970. This ensures the agent “knows” what the real person knew (their scientific expertise, cultural background, etc.) and speaks with their voice. Feasibility is high if we use modern language model techniques. A large language model (LLM) can be fine-tuned or instructed on the collected writings, letters, and interviews of the person. For example, the Oppenheimer agent’s knowledge base would include his physics papers on neutron stars and quantum theory, wartime technical reports, and post-war speeches. The corpus should also include documents the scientist is likely to have read or cited (to give them relevant outside knowledge up to that era). Given the volume of textual material available, this is viable. We may not need to train a model from scratch; an approach could be a retrieval-augmented generation, where each agent has a vector database of its documents and pulls relevant snippets to inform its responses. This way, the core LLM can be a general model, but it always consults the scientist’s own corpus when formulating answers, keeping it historically tethered.
Weighted Citation Networks: Incorporating a weighted citation or influence network into the agents can enhance authenticity. The idea is to map which scientists influenced each other’s thinking and how often they referenced one another. For instance, we know Oppenheimer frequently discussed Bohr’s ideas, Feynman was mentored by Bethe, and Szilard corresponded with Einstein. A network graph can be constructed where nodes are people or key papers and edges indicate influence or citations. Recent research has even mapped Manhattan Project collaboration networks using data science – e.g. Janosov (2023) built a graph of Manhattan Project scientists based on how often they are mentioned together in Wikipedia, finding strong links (Oppenheimer is strongly linked to Fermi, etc.)​
phys.org
. Figure 1 below illustrates such a network of prominent scientists and their connections​
phys.org
. By assigning weights to connections (perhaps via number of co-mentions or citations in their writings), each agent can have a bias to “cite” or bring up those figures or sources. For example, an Oppenheimer agent might be more likely to reference a concept from Niels Bohr if Bohr heavily influenced him (as indicated by a strong link in the network). Technically, this could be implemented by injecting relevant references into the agent’s context or by adjusting the probability it will use certain source texts. It’s feasible to generate these networks from existing data (publications, letters, or even Wikipedia as Janosov demonstrated) and use them as a guide for dialogue (the simulation could track when one agent references another’s work and increase that link’s weight to simulate spreading influence).


Figure 1: Network visualization of relationships between Manhattan Project scientists (based on co-mentions in public sources​
phys.org
). Such a graph can inform weighted influences and citation patterns among AI agents in the simulation.
Personality Profiles from Biographies: Beyond knowledge, the agents should emulate the personality and communication style of each individual. Feasibility here depends on encoding traits gleaned from biographies, interviews, and portrayals. We can create a profile for each scientist – e.g. Oppenheimer: eloquent, philosophical, occasionally cryptic, with a tendency to quote literature; Feynman: informal, witty, irreverent, with penchant for analogies; Teller: assertive, logical but with a zeal that can come off as stubborn; Szilard: imaginative, moralizing, with hypotheticals; Bohr: thoughtful, Socratic, sometimes abstruse; and so on. These profiles could be translated into prompt instructions or fine-tuning data. For instance, we might include example lines from their writings as style samples. Modern LLMs are quite capable of adopting a style when given examples or explicit instruction​
medium.com
. In fact, even without fine-tuning, users have gotten ChatGPT to mimic historical figures by prompts that describe the persona and style​
medium.com
. We can take this further by systematically tuning it: one approach is fine-tuning a separate model for each person on their corpus (ensuring the model picks up speech patterns), but that may be resource-intensive. A lighter approach is using a single powerful model (like GPT-4 via API) and supplying a detailed system message about the character (“You are X, you have these traits, here are some sample quotes…”). The feasibility of capturing personality is high, as demonstrated by existing apps that “use state-of-the-art AI (GPT-4) to bring historical figures to life” in authentic conversations​
hellohistory.ai
. The key is careful prompt engineering and iteration to lock down distinctive voices.
Tuned LLM Parameters: We can adjust generation parameters to suit each agent’s expected behavior. For example, temperature controls randomness: a lower temperature might make an agent more factual and consistent (perhaps good for someone like Bethe or Fermi known for logical rigor), whereas a slightly higher temperature could make an agent more creative or tangential (maybe for someone like Szilard who speculated often). Top_p (nucleus sampling) can be tuned similarly to shape the distribution of outputs (ensuring less likely words are sometimes chosen if we want a colorful narrative). The context window size is also important – since each agent should recall previous dialogue turns to stay coherent, we’ll need models with large context (or use summarization techniques). Current models like GPT-4 offer up to 8K or even 32K token context, which might handle a few dozen turns of conversation; for more, see Section 7 on scaling. These parameter tunings are technically straightforward and part of the normal use of LLMs. We might, for instance, set a uniform random seed or use deterministic decoding for certain agents to reflect a very consistent thinking process, whereas another agent might get more variability to reflect an unpredictable mind. All these adjustments are feasible via standard AI libraries or API settings.
Ethical and Accuracy Constraints: While the technical ability to create these agents is strong, we must consider constraints to keep the simulation historically accurate and ethically appropriate. One major concern is the risk of “hallucination” or an agent producing statements the real person never said or would never agree with. Large language models can sound convincing yet be factually wrong or anachronistic if not constrained​
washingtonpost.com
. For a historical simulation, this is problematic – we don’t want Oppenheimer AI asserting false physics facts or misquoting policy positions. Mitigation strategies include using the curated corpus as a grounding (so that the AI’s knowledge and even phrasing come from real sources), and implementing a verification layer that checks generated statements against known historical data. Another risk is the alteration of controversial stances due to modern biases or safety filters. A recent example highlighted that an AI simulating historical figures would sometimes “whitewash” their views – e.g., making a Nazi figure apologetic when in reality they were not, largely because the AI is prevented from generating hateful content and thus gives a sanitized response​
washingtonpost.com
​
washingtonpost.com
. In our context, this could manifest if, say, an AI model is uncomfortable producing the kind of stern pro-bomb rhetoric that someone like General Groves or Edward Teller might have used; it might instead tone it down or insert regret that the real person never had. This undermines historical accuracy. We must strike a balance by configuring the AI to allow contentious viewpoints if they are true to the character (within reason and clearly marked as part of a simulation). Bias detection mechanisms (discussed more in Section 3) will be needed to flag when an agent starts deviating from the historical record. Additionally, all agents should be time-aware – they should not incorporate knowledge from after 1970 or so (unless the simulation explicitly imagines them meeting later). The training corpus cutoff and possibly a system instruction (“your knowledge is only up to year X”) can enforce this. From an ethical standpoint, we also should be transparent that these are simulations and not actual quotes. A clear disclaimer (like the one used in the Historical Figures Chat app: “A.I. is not guaranteed to be accurate… It is impossible to know what Historical Figures may have said.”​
washingtonpost.com
) is necessary whenever the simulation is presented, especially in educational use. In summary, the design is feasible but requires careful alignment: the AI personas must be tuned to remain within the bounds of what is known about each individual’s views (to avoid gross anachronisms or misrepresentations), and we must handle the interplay between historical truth and AI safety filters so that we don’t end up with overly sanitized or erroneous dialogues. With a strong curation of data and iterative testing, modeling these agents with the desired fidelity is achievable using today’s LLM technology.
3. Simulation Protocols
With the agents in place, we need a framework for how their discussions will be conducted and monitored. The simulation protocol defines how the conversation is initiated, how turns are taken, and how we ensure it yields meaningful results. Key considerations include the format of dialogue (e.g. round-robin), tracking the flow of ideas, and detecting bias or drift from historical authenticity.
Round-Robin Discussion Mechanism: A feasible approach is to conduct the AI dialogue in a round-robin style, where each scientist agent gets a turn to speak in sequence. This ensures all voices are heard and one agent doesn’t dominate. Practically, we can implement this by having a controller process that prompts each agent in turn, providing the recent dialogue as context. For example, Agent1 (Oppenheimer) is given an initial question or topic (like “Is it ethical to use the bomb?”) and responds. Then Agent2 (perhaps Szilard) gets the entire conversation so far and produces a reply, and so on through AgentN, then back to Agent1. This cycling is repeated for a set number of rounds. Round-robin is feasible and has been used in multi-agent chat experiments to simulate discussions or debates. It ensures a structured flow. We can also experiment with moderated discussions – e.g., introduce a “moderator” agent (or simply the system prompt) that occasionally summarizes or refocuses the topic if the agents stray. The structure could allow for free-flowing debate but within an ordered turn-taking so it’s easier to follow and analyze.
Discussion Topics and Prompts: The conversation will center on ethics, nuclear policy, and science. To simulate realistic exchanges, we can start with a broad question (e.g. “What are your thoughts on the use of the atomic bomb on Japan?”) or even a scenario (e.g. a mock panel discussion in 1946 about the future of nuclear weapons). The agents should then carry it forward, introducing subtopics like international control, the arms race, scientific responsibility, etc. We might initiate multiple distinct sessions on different prompts (for instance, one on “Should scientists advise government on how to use new weapons?”, another on “How do you feel about your role in the Manhattan Project?”) to explore various angles. The protocol should define if we run one continuous long conversation or several shorter themed conversations.
Idea and Citation Propagation: An interesting measure of the simulation’s richness is tracking how ideas spread among the agents. We want to see, for example, if Szilard raises the concept of a demonstration test instead of combat use, does that idea get picked up by Oppenheimer or Bethe in later rounds? If Bohr mentions “world government,” do others reference that term subsequently? We will instrument the simulation to track references and citations across turns. Because we have the weighted citation network built in, the agents might naturally cite each other or common sources (e.g., Bohr’s earlier principles, or the Franck Report). We can log every time an agent mentions another by name or cites a known document. Feasibly, this can be done via simple text parsing of outputs or more sophisticated entity recognition. Over 10+ rounds, we can visualize a graph of how an initial idea introduced by one agent propagates or transforms through the dialogue. This is analogous to tracing information diffusion in social networks, but here we have full observability. If some key ideas fail to propagate (say one agent’s point is ignored by all others), that also yields insight. Technically, enabling this propagation doesn’t require altering the agent generation itself – it’s an analysis layer on top of the generated text. However, we might enhance propagation by occasionally reminding agents of what others said (“As Feynman suggested earlier, ... do you agree?”) to simulate active listening. That would be a prompt engineering tactic to ensure responsiveness.
Maintaining Historical Perspectives: We must ensure agents largely stick to historically accurate perspectives. This means if an agent starts to express a view far outside what the real person might have held, we detect and correct it. For example, if the Teller agent suddenly advocates for scrapping all nuclear weapons (which would be out-of-character given Teller’s actual stance in the 1950s), that’s a deviation. We can implement bias detection or out-of-character detection in a few ways. One is to have a secondary AI classifier or heuristic check each statement against a knowledge base of known positions. For instance, we compile key positions (pro or anti certain policies) for each person from historical records. Each agent’s output can be compared to their profile – if it’s off, the system could flag it or gently steer the agent back in subsequent turns (perhaps by adding a reminder in that agent’s prompt like “You feel strongly that developing the H-bomb is necessary, despite others’ reservations,” if Teller was straying into agreeing with opponents too much). Another approach is manually reviewing transcripts during development and adjusting the persona definitions. Because the simulation is closed (not a live system constantly changed by users), we can iteratively refine the prompts to minimize ahistorical behavior. Moderation filters should also be in place: if an agent output includes any content that violates ethical guidelines (e.g. ad hominem attacks, or sensitive content beyond what is historically appropriate), the system can intercept. However, since these are professional scientists discussing ethics, extreme content is unlikely – the main moderation needed is around potentially sensitive historical references (like if the conversation touches on wartime sentiments toward the Japanese or Soviets, ensuring it doesn’t produce slurs or overly graphic content). Bias in terms of presentism (injecting today’s values) is a subtle issue: the agents should ideally speak from their time’s viewpoint, even if it contains biases that today we disapprove of. To keep historical realism, some uncomfortable views might surface (e.g., a dismissive attitude that “the Japanese military would never surrender otherwise”), but we handle this by contextualizing rather than censoring, unless it crosses into hate speech. The feasibility of bias detection is moderate – it may not catch everything automatically, but combined with careful prompt setup and periodic human-in-the-loop checks, we can manage agent fidelity to their historical selves.
In summary, the protocols for running the simulation – a structured, rotating dialogue with instrumentation for idea flow and guardrails for authenticity – are quite feasible. Multi-agent conversation with LLMs has been demonstrated in research (with agents that even initiate conversations spontaneously) and implementing a turn-based debate is straightforward with a controlling script. The main challenge is the continuous monitoring of content for alignment with historical reality, but with predefined roles and static personas, this is manageable. We will log all interactions for later analysis (which is useful for evaluation in Section 6), and we will likely iterate on the protocol in pilot tests (for example, we might find we need to limit each agent’s response length to prevent monologues, or enforce that they ask each other questions to keep it interactive). These are tunable parameters in the simulation design. Overall, initiating a roundtable discussion among these AI scientists on ethics and policy is not only feasible, it promises to be an illuminating experiment.
4. Technical Implementation
Implementing the above design will require selecting appropriate tools, APIs, and techniques for prompt engineering, as well as addressing legal and safety considerations. Here we outline a possible tech stack and method for building the simulation system:
LLM Platform and Tools: A central decision is whether to use a cloud API (like OpenAI’s GPT-4/3.5, Anthropic’s Claude, etc.) or an open-source model hosted locally. Using GPT-4 via API is attractive given its demonstrated capability in role-playing historical figures with high fidelity​
hellohistory.ai
. Indeed, products like “Hello History” have shown that GPT-4 can handle multi-turn conversations as famous individuals out-of-the-box​
hellohistory.ai
. However, cost and control are considerations (discussed later). On the open-source side, models like LLaMA 2, GPT-J, or Falcon could be fine-tuned on our custom corpora for each agent. Fine-tuning 8–10 separate models might be heavy; an alternative is one model with a special token or prompt section indicating which persona to emulate. There are libraries and frameworks to streamline multi-agent setups. For example, LangChain provides classes for generative agents and memory management​
python.langchain.com.cn
. We can leverage LangChain’s GenerativeAgent module, which already implements a lot of the memory and retrieval logic, as evidenced by their tutorial combining vector stores and time-weighted memory​
python.langchain.com.cn
​
python.langchain.com.cn
. Another helpful tool is the HuggingFace Transformers library for managing the models and tokenizers if we go open-source. If using an API, the OpenAI Python client or equivalent will be used to orchestrate chat completions. Additionally, a vector database like FAISS or Weaviate can store each agent’s documents for retrieval. We might also utilize the OpenAI function-calling or ReAct pattern if we integrate tools (though here the main “tool” for agents might simply be their document retrieval).
Knowledge Integration via Retrieval-Augmentation: To keep agents factual and allow citations, we can implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. This means that when an agent is about to generate a response, the system will first query that agent’s knowledge base for relevant texts (based on the conversation context or a question posed). For instance, if the discussion turns to the Franck Report, the Szilard or Seaborg agents could retrieve an excerpt from the actual Franck Report to quote or summarize. We can design prompts like: “Relevant excerpt from your papers: [TEXT]. Using this, answer...” so that the LLM has authoritative material at its fingertips, reducing hallucination. This requires an extra step each turn (embedding the last exchange, searching the vector store, etc.) but is technically well-supported by existing frameworks.
Prompt Engineering Techniques: Crafting the right system and user prompts will be vital. Each agent will likely operate with a dedicated system prompt that encodes its identity and style (the persona profile from the design). For example, Oppenheimer’s system prompt might say: “You are J. Robert Oppenheimer, physicist, age 42 (in 1946). You speak thoughtfully, often weighing moral considerations. You occasionally reference literature (e.g. Sanskrit texts) and you have knowledge of physics and recent events up to 1946. You do not know anything that happened after 1970. You feel a sense of responsibility and concern about nuclear weapons.” This sets the stage. The conversation context then comes as the user prompt for each turn, possibly with an instruction like “Given the above discussion, continue with your perspective.” We will likely use few-shot examples during development (not in the final run) to test styles – for instance, provide the model with a sample Q&A where Oppenheimer answers a question in a historically accurate way, to see if it mimics it. If fine-tuning, these prompts and examples would become part of the training. Another technique is dynamic prompting: adding reminders or adjusting tone on the fly if we see issues. For instance, if an agent starts drifting, the next prompt injection might include a line in the system role clarifying their stance. We should also define tokens or a format to delineate each speaker in the combined conversation context so that the model clearly knows which agent is speaking at a time (the orchestration script can handle that).
Legal Considerations (Copyright and Likeness): Using historical figures’ writings raises some legal and ethical points. Many Manhattan Project scientists’ works are old enough that they may be in public domain (works of U.S. government like Oppenheimer’s official reports are public domain; works published pre-1928 are PD; letters and memoirs vary). However, some sources (like Teller’s 2001 memoir or Feynman’s published books) are under copyright. For a research prototype, use of excerpts could fall under fair use, especially since the purpose is transformative (creating an educational simulation) and not just reproducing the text. We should still be cautious not to have the AI regurgitate large verbatim sections of copyrighted text. Fine-tuning the model on those texts is a gray area, but since the output is new dialog, it might be acceptable if it doesn’t quote big passages directly without attribution. As a mitigation, using retrieval with attribution (the agent can say “as I wrote in my book… [quote]”) might actually be safer because it’s explicitly quoting a source. We will need to review case by case which documents we can legally incorporate. On the likeness front, these individuals are deceased, so right-of-publicity issues are minimal (those usually apply to living persons). Nevertheless, we should portray them respectfully and accurately to avoid any claims of defamation or misrepresentation of legacy. The project should likely include a disclaimer that this is a fictional AI recreation and not endorsed by any estates or institutions. If this were a public-facing product, avoiding any branding that implies the real person is speaking would be wise (for instance, not using someone’s signature or voice without permission – but here we stick to text).
Content Moderation and Safety: Even though these are historical personas, we are still using LLMs which might output problematic content if prompted a certain way. We have to incorporate moderation layers for both the input and output of the agents. If using an API like OpenAI, their built-in content filters will catch overtly disallowed content (e.g. extremist language, sexual content, etc., which is unlikely relevant here). But as mentioned, those filters can also cause the model to produce ahistorical niceties (like the Nazi apologizing example)​
washingtonpost.com
. One solution is to use an LLM with a more flexible moderation (or self-hosted model) and implement our own nuanced filters. We could use a tool like Google’s Perspective API or an open-source toxicity detector on each message to ensure nothing egregious slips through. However, we might permit a certain level of historical rhetoric (for example, negative views of enemy nations expressed in a historical context) as long as we frame it in context and for educational purposes. If an agent unexpectedly went on an unrelated tangent or someone tried to hack the system by inserting a prompt to derail it (less an issue if it’s not interactive with end-users), we should have a mechanism to stop or reset. Since our simulation is mostly self-contained, the main safety focus is on output verification. We can have an automated fact-checking process where important factual claims made by agents are compared with a knowledge base – e.g., if an agent says “the bomb yielded 20 kilotons” we can check that against known values. If an inconsistency is found, the system could log it for review or even have another AI agent (a “critic”) in the loop that corrects the statement politely in the conversation. This might actually add to the realism, as scientists often corrected each other. Imagine Bethe’s agent saying “Actually, the yield was about 20 kt, not 5 kt, as mentioned.” This kind of factual interplay could be beneficial. Technically, implementing a fact-checker could be done with a combination of a knowledge graph of key data and another language model that is prompted to verify statements using that data.
In terms of development, we might prototype using Python notebooks and frameworks: set up each agent with a prompt template, then simulate turns by calling the model iteratively. Tools like Traces or ParallelChain might help manage multi-agent dialogues. Given the complexity, building the system incrementally (first get two agents talking coherently, then add more) will be the approach. In summary, the technical implementation is quite feasible with current AI infrastructure. Many building blocks (LLM APIs, retrieval systems, memory frameworks, etc.) exist to support this. The heaviest lift is ensuring all these pieces work together seamlessly and efficiently. Also, we must remain mindful of the legal use of data and implement the simulation in a way that respects both the rights and the nuanced legacies of these historical figures.
5. Visualization Dashboard
Beyond the raw text transcripts of the AI conversations, the project envisions an interactive dashboard to help users explore and analyze the simulation. This dashboard would visualize various metrics – sentiment, citation networks, alignment vs. history, and areas of agreement or conflict among the agents. We assess the feasibility of building such a dashboard and the components it would include:
Sentiment Tracking: We can perform sentiment analysis on each agent’s messages in the conversation to chart how the emotional tone evolves. For example, we might show a timeline (round by round) of sentiment scores (positive/negative or a scale of concern vs confidence). If Oppenheimer’s agent gradually expresses more anxiety or remorse as the discussion deepens, that would show up as a line trending into negative sentiment. Tools for this are readily available (NLTK/VADER, HuggingFace sentiment models) and could be applied to the transcript. Visualizing could be done with a simple line graph or even a heatmap (agents on one axis, time on another, colored by sentiment). This helps identify if the conversation is becoming tense or if consensus is making it more positive.
Citation and Influence Network: As mentioned, we will track when agents cite each other or external sources. The dashboard can display an interactive network graph where nodes are agents (and possibly key documents or external figures they mention) and edges represent references or influence. For instance, if in the conversation Szilard convinces Fermi of something, an edge or highlight might appear between them. Over many rounds, the network could accumulate arrows indicating direction of influence (who is citing or agreeing with whom). A user could click on an edge to see the snippet of dialogue where that reference occurred. The feasibility of this is high using JavaScript libraries like D3.js or Cytoscape.js for network visualization. We essentially have to output a JSON of nodes and links from the simulation log and let the front-end render it. An example of a similar network (based on historical data rather than the simulation) was shown in Figure 1; we would be doing the same but for the AI discourse.
Historical Alignment/Divergence: One of the more novel visualizations is comparing the content of the AI discussion to actual historical positions. We could create a simple “radar chart” or set of gauges for each agent: one axis could be “alignment with known historical stance” (which might be binary or a percentage match of key points). If an agent says something that is directly documented (say verbatim or paraphrased from their real quotes), that could increase an accuracy score. Conversely, if they make statements that have no historical record or contradict it, that could show up as divergence. Representing this might require some backend analysis – for example, we could have a list of expected arguments each person historically made on the topic of ethics and check them off as they appear in the dialogue. If the AI Oppenheimer touches on all major themes Oppenheimer actually spoke about (such as international control, fear of a future war, moral responsibility of scientists), his “alignment meter” would be high. If he veers into territory Oppenheimer never addressed, that meter might drop. This feature is feasible but needs expert input to define the “ground truth” points for comparison. Alternatively, alignment could be measured via semantic similarity: take the AI agent’s statements and compare via embedding to actual historical texts of that person. A high similarity might indicate it’s speaking in character. We could visualize divergence as outlier points. This part of the dashboard would be very insightful for expert reviewers.
Areas of Agreement and Conflict: We want the dashboard to highlight where agents agree or disagree on issues. This could be shown through a matrix or chart of stances. For instance, after the simulation, we might summarize: On the question “Should the atomic bomb have been used on Japan?”, X agents say yes (or justified at the time) and Y agents say no (or with conditions). The dashboard might have a table of key ethical questions with checkmarks or Xs for each agent. Another representation is clustering the agents by viewpoint – perhaps using dimensionality reduction on their expressed opinions. In a visualization, one could see Oppenheimer, Bohr, and Szilard clustering on the “caution/anti-nuclear” side versus Teller and maybe Fermi clustering on a more “pro-development” side (this is hypothetical, but likely for certain issues like developing the H-bomb). Technically, we could perform topic modeling or argument extraction on the dialogue to identify main points of contention, then see which agents align on those. The UI could allow filtering the transcript by topic or by agent to examine exactly what was said on each side of a debate.
Interactive Features: The dashboard could allow selecting an agent to view their “profile” with a summary of their persona and perhaps key quotes from the simulation. It could also allow stepping through the conversation round by round with highlights (like showing at Round 5, these were the sentiments, the network edges, etc.). Time-syncing multiple charts is feasible with modern web frameworks. For instance, using a framework like Streamlit or a Jupyter notebook interface for a prototype could quickly demonstrate these visualizations, and later a more polished web app with React/D3 could be developed.
The feasibility of building such a dashboard is good – it involves standard data visualization techniques applied to the logs produced by the simulation. We might need to develop some custom analysis scripts to derive the data (sentiment scores, alignment metrics, etc.), but nothing is beyond current capabilities. The main constraint might be ensuring the data is not overwhelming: a 300-round discussion with 8 agents is 2400 messages; visualizing every inter-reference could become cluttered. We will likely summarize or allow zooming into subsets (like view the first 50 rounds, etc.). We might also include a filter to hide trivial dialogue and focus on substantive exchanges for clarity. In terms of tech stack for the dashboard: Python libraries like Plotly or Bokeh could be used for a quick interactive prototype. For a more sharable tool, a web app with a backend (Flask/Django serving the data) and a frontend using something like Vue or React with chart libraries would work. Since this is a research/educational tool, using open-source components is preferred for flexibility. In conclusion, the visualization component is quite feasible and would greatly enhance understanding of the simulation. It transforms the raw text into intelligible patterns and insights, making it easier to evaluate and present results. It also provides an interface for experts to provide feedback – for example, a historian could look at the alignment chart and quickly spot if something is off, or a user could click on a conflict edge to see exactly what the disagreement was. Building this dashboard will require multidisciplinary effort (data science + web dev), but each piece is standard practice in those fields.
6. Evaluation Metrics
Evaluating the simulation’s success is crucial, given its dual goals of historical accuracy and generating insightful dialogue. We need both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Here we outline how we can evaluate: (a) the historical accuracy/coherence of the simulation, and (b) whether it produces valuable or novel insights, using potential expert review as well.
Historical Accuracy and Factuality: One metric is the percentage of statements made by the agents that are historically factual (or at least not known to be false). We can measure this by manually verifying key facts mentioned. For instance, if an agent references an event or scientific detail, we check against historical sources. We can also track if any hallucinated historical events occur (which should be zero). A related metric is how often an agent’s utterances align with that person’s known opinions. We could have a checklist of major known views for each individual (e.g., “Szilard advocated for demonstrating the bomb”, “Teller supported development of H-bomb”, etc.) and see if those points are expressed in the simulation. If our personas are well-crafted, we expect each agent to touch on most of their hallmark positions during a lengthy discussion. Conversely, if an agent voices something completely contrary to their real stance, that’s a hit on accuracy. We might quantify this as an “in-character accuracy score” per agent, possibly determined by expert review or by comparing to a reference knowledge base (as discussed for the dashboard alignment feature).
Dialogue Coherence and Quality: We should evaluate the conversation for coherence (does it stay on topic, do the arguments logically follow). This can be partially measured by conversation analytics like whether questions get answered, whether each turn is relevant to the previous, etc. One could use NLP metrics like perplexity of the next turn given previous (lower perplexity might indicate more predictable/coherent responses in context) or embedding similarity between an agent’s response and the prompt it’s addressing. However, human judgment is likely the best here: we (or external reviewers) read the transcript and rate how natural and logical the dialogue is. If it reads like a plausible meeting of these minds, that’s a success. If it devolves into non-sequiturs or repetitive statements, we need to adjust the system. Coherence also entails consistency of persona – each agent should have a consistent voice and not suddenly adopt another’s mannerisms or knowledge. We can monitor that by checking, for example, that Feynman’s agent doesn’t slip and mention something only Bethe would know, etc. These are cases for qualitative evaluation.
Expert Review Process: Given the historical nature, having historians of science or subject-matter experts review the simulation is important. We can set up an evaluation where an expert reads the dialogue and identifies inaccuracies or implausible interactions. Their feedback might be narrative (“Scientist X would never have likely conceded this point so easily”) or point out missing context (“They failed to mention the Franck Report, which would have certainly come up”). We can incorporate such feedback into refining the model. So one metric is simply expert satisfaction: perhaps on a scale, how convincing did they find the simulation? Did it surface the key ethical dilemmas accurately? We could also do a blind test: give an expert two dialogues, one written by a human historian as a hypothetical discussion and one generated by the AI, and see if they can tell which is which or rate them comparatively. If the AI dialogue is close in quality to a human-written scenario, that’s high praise.
Emergence of Novel Insights: One hope is that by having these AI agents converse, they might combine ideas in new ways or highlight less obvious points – effectively, produce insights that were not explicitly in any single source. We need to gauge if any novel thought comes out that provides value. This is inherently hard to quantify. However, we could look for instances where the AI conversation yields a conclusion or a framing that real history did not record those individuals saying together. For example, perhaps the simulation leads to a consensus statement about ethical responsibility that, while consistent with their views, was never actually articulated by that exact group. That could be considered a novel emergent insight. We might catalog such moments and have experts evaluate if it’s indeed novel and non-trivial. Another angle: the simulation might bring lesser-known references to the fore (maybe the Bohr agent cites a then-obscure memo that others then discuss – shining light on a historically overlooked detail). To measure this, one could track references in the simulation and see if the frequency distribution differs from the primary training data (indicating some creative recombination). Again, human interpretation will ultimately decide if an insight is meaningful.
Agent Agreement and Outcomes: We can measure how much agreement or disagreement occurred. For example, did the agents reach any consensus by the end? If we simulate multiple sessions, how often is there a convergence of opinion versus a stalemate? This can be quantified by sentiment or stance analysis as mentioned (e.g., count how many agents are pro vs con on a final question). If the goal of the simulation is to generate thought-provoking dialogue rather than reach a single answer, we might not favor full consensus; some healthy debate is a good outcome. But it’s interesting to measure shifts: did any agent change their stated position from the beginning to the end of the conversation (which could indicate persuasion)? If yes, that’s a dynamic to evaluate – is that change historically plausible? For instance, would an AI Teller ever be persuaded by AI Oppenheimer to reconsider, or vice versa? If it happened, it might signal the AI went beyond strict historical fidelity (since in life, Teller remained quite steadfast). We should evaluate if such shifts are acceptable creative license or not.
Technical Metrics: We should also log technical performance: how many times the AI needed moderation (if any outputs were filtered), how often we had to intervene, etc. Ideally those are minimal if the system is well-tuned. Another metric: the computational efficiency (did the model respond in reasonable time, did memory usage blow up, etc.). While not directly a measure of “dialogue quality,” these affect feasibility (addressed in Section 7).
To implement evaluation, we will likely replay the conversations with instrumentation and possibly create scoring scripts. Some metrics like factual accuracy might be partially automated by checking against a database of known facts (for example, using an information retrieval system to see if each factual claim appears in the corpus). Others like persona consistency might use an embedding comparison between each agent’s turns and that agent’s source material (the hypothesis being, in-character lines will be closer in vector space to the agent’s training data than to another’s). Finally, after internal evaluation, a user study could be considered for a later phase: having students or historians interact with or observe the simulation and gather feedback on educational value. In summary, evaluation will be multi-faceted. We expect to iterate: run the simulation, identify errors or dull parts, adjust the model or prompts, and run again. Each of the above metrics gives a way to measure improvement. The combination of automated checks and expert/human review will ensure the simulation remains grounded in truth and is engaging to its intended audience.
7. Expanded Simulation Component
One ambition of the project is to simulate 300+ rounds of discussion, potentially to see long-term dynamics and deeper exploration of ideas. A 300-round dialogue among several agents is essentially a long-running conversation that tests the limits of the model’s memory and the system’s performance. Here we evaluate the feasibility of this and how to manage coherence, storage, and cost for such an extended simulation.
Memory and Context Management: Most LLMs cannot simply take a conversation of thousands of turns as direct input due to context window limits. Even with a 32k-token model, 300 rounds × (let’s say) 200 tokens per round = 60,000 tokens, which is beyond that. So we need a strategy for preserving context without supplying the entire history each time. This is where techniques from the Generative Agents research become invaluable. In Park et al.’s “Generative Agents”, they introduced a memory stream and a retrieval mechanism that surfaces only the most relevant memories for the agent at a given moment​

​
lukew.com
. We can implement a similar approach: maintain an internal log of the conversation (which we’ll have anyway) and periodically summarize or distill it for the agents. For instance, we could generate summaries every 10 rounds that capture key points, and use those summaries as part of context for later rounds instead of the full detail. Also, each agent could keep a personal “notebook” of important facts or sentiments it has expressed or learned, which can be referenced later. A time-weighted memory algorithm (like in LangChain’s implementation​
python.langchain.com.cn
) could be used – this gives more weight to recent exchanges but doesn’t entirely lose older ones, it just decays them unless they are particularly salient. We might also classify topics such that if the conversation shifts, the model can safely forget some details of the old topic. With these methods, 300 rounds is feasible in terms of coherence. Essentially, we will have created a system where the conversation history is compressed and indexed, and each new turn only sees a digest of the past plus any directly related earlier statements. This prevents context window overflow. Another trick: we could restart the conversation in segments but feed the agents an anchoring summary of previous segments. For example, simulate 100 rounds, pause and produce a “state of discussion” summary, then start a fresh chat session with that summary as initial context, and continue for another 100 rounds, and so on. The continuity might suffer slightly, but if done carefully (and possibly with overlap), it can work.
Scaling to 300 Rounds Performance: Running 300 rounds with multiple agents is computationally intensive. Each round involves generating one response per agent (assuming round-robin). If we have 8 agents, 300 rounds means 2400 turns/responses total. If using a large model via API, that’s 2400 API calls. The cost depends on tokens per call; if each response plus prompt is, say, 1000 tokens, that’s 2.4 million tokens processed. With GPT-4’s pricing (roughly $0.03 per 1K input and $0.06 per 1K output as of 2025), this might cost on the order of ~$150 for a single 2.4M-token run. It’s not trivial, but for a research project, it’s not outrageous either (though iterative development could rack up costs). Using a smaller model or GPT-3.5 would be cheaper but might reduce quality. If we host our own model on GPU, the cost is in compute time: 2.4k turns at, suppose, 5 seconds per turn (just as a guess for a large model on decent hardware) is 12,000 seconds (~3.3 hours) of compute. That’s actually not too bad. With optimization or using multiple GPUs, it could be faster. We might also parallelize some parts if we simulate that not all agents need to go strictly sequentially (though round-robin inherently is sequential in each round). For storage, storing the entire conversation text is trivial (a few MB at most). More heavy is storing intermediate model states if we needed to (but we likely don’t store model state per turn, just the generated text). If we generate embeddings for memory retrieval, that’s also manageable size (each message embedding maybe 768-d float vector, times a couple thousand messages – a few MB). So storage is not a big concern.
Quality Over 300 Rounds: A big question is whether the conversation will remain meaningful after so many turns. Human discussions would likely reach a conclusion or run out of new points by then. There is a risk of looping or degeneracy: the agents might start repeating arguments or going in circles. We will need to monitor this. Possibly, we could introduce external events or new questions at certain intervals to keep it fresh (for example, “Now the year is 1949 and the Soviets have tested a bomb – how does this impact your view?”, injecting a scenario change mid-simulation). This would make the long simulation more dynamic. Technically, that means altering the prompt context with new information partway through, which is doable. If the goal is to see purely emergent continuation, we might avoid interference, but then we accept that by 300 rounds the agents could meander. Another approach is simply to run multiple shorter simulations and treat them as multiple “rounds” of an overall exercise, rather than one single thread of 300 turns. The phrasing “300+ agent discussion rounds” likely means one continuous thread though, so we will assume that challenge. Ensuring agent memory across such a long run is the hardest part, but as discussed, using summarization and retrieval-based memory makes it feasible. The generative agent research has even looked at scaling up the number of agents and interactions in a simulated world. For instance, one recent work created hundreds of agents in a social simulation (AgentSociety, 2024) and noted the need for scalable architecture​
arxiv.org
​
arxiv.org
. They confirm that empowering agents with LLMs yields human-like interactions, but complexity grows with more agents or longer interactions. Our case is fewer agents but long duration; the complexity is somewhat similar (lots of sequential dependencies).
Potential Failure Modes: We should be aware of what could go wrong in a long simulation. One is drift: the conversation might drift from the initial question to something completely different as tangents accumulate. We can evaluate if that’s acceptable or if we want to periodically refocus (maybe through the moderator mechanism). Another is contradiction: an agent might forget its earlier stance after 200 turns and accidentally contradict itself. Our memory system should help prevent that by reminding the agent of its prior statements (the agent’s own summary of beliefs can be stored). Another issue is simply diminishing returns: after a certain point, the dialogue might not be adding new value. If we find that by round 100 everything interesting has been said, pushing to 300 might only yield repetition. In that case, it’s an opportunity to refine prompts to encourage deeper or more diverse discussion, or it might indicate that practically, an MVP could use fewer rounds. However, sometimes unexpected new angles do arise if the model is creative enough – it might simulate the passage of time or changes in personal feelings.
In summary, running 300+ rounds is ambitious but technically feasible with careful design. We will need to incorporate advanced memory handling to maintain coherence. Compute cost is non-trivial but can be managed especially if we use efficient models or only occasionally use the heaviest model for critical parts. This long simulation could produce a treasure trove of interaction data to analyze, which might justify the cost. If it proves too unwieldy, we can scale back incrementally. The feasibility analysis suggests it’s possible, but we would plan it as a later-stage experiment once the system works for shorter conversations, thereby debugging any issues before letting it run that long.
8. Practical Constraints and Opportunities
Finally, we consider the practical aspects of executing this project: resources required (time, cost, compute) for a prototype versus a full implementation, potential use cases that justify the effort, and the open challenges and next steps to refine the approach. We also suggest an MVP to start with and highlight existing tools or datasets that can accelerate development.
Development Effort and Timeline: Building the full system (with multiple agents, memory, dashboard, etc.) is a significant project likely requiring a team with expertise in AI, history, and software development. However, an MVP (Minimum Viable Prototype) can be much simpler. An MVP might involve just two or three agents (say Oppenheimer, Teller, Szilard to get a range of views) engaging in a shorter conversation (10-20 turns) on a focused question. This prototype could be done with an off-the-shelf LLM (e.g. GPT-4) via a script, without the full memory or visualization – essentially to validate that the agents can hold an interesting, semi-accurate discussion. Such an MVP could potentially be built in a few weeks: a single developer could prompt-tune and get sample dialogues, then manually evaluate them. The cost for that would be on the order of a few dollars of API calls or just local GPU time if using an open model.
Full Build Resource Estimates: For the full envisioned system (8+ agents, long simulations, interactive dashboard), we should anticipate a longer timeline. Collecting and processing the historical corpus might take a couple of months of research work (scanning archives, cleaning transcripts, etc.). Developing the AI agent system (including fine-tuning or prompt engineering each persona and implementing multi-agent orchestration with memory) could be another few months, especially with testing and iteration. The visualization dashboard development (front-end + integration) might take an additional 1-2 months. So we could be looking at ~6 months for a small team to reach a polished result. In terms of compute, if we plan to use a cloud API extensively, we should budget perhaps a few thousand dollars for experimentation (given that each full simulation run might cost $100+ as calculated, and we’ll do many during development). If opting for open-source models, we might invest in a dedicated server or cloud GPU instances. A single modern GPU (like an NVIDIA A100 with 40GB memory) could likely handle a 13B-70B parameter model for inference; renting such an instance is maybe $1-$3 per hour, which is quite affordable for testing. For 300-round runs, we might run overnight jobs. Storage of data (the text archives, logs) is negligible in cost relative to compute.
Use Cases and Applications: The project sits at an intersection of education, research, and entertainment:
Educational Use: This simulation could be used in academic settings (history or ethics classes) to let students “witness” a debate among Manhattan Project figures. It could also be an exhibit in a science museum or on a website accompanying documentaries (imagine an interactive feature: “Ask the Manhattan Project panel a question”). The dashboard with sentiment and networks can teach how opinions form and clash.
Research Use: Historians or social scientists might use the tool to test hypotheses about how these discussions might have gone or to communicate historical ethical dilemmas in a new way. It’s also a research case study for human-AI collaboration: using AI to reconstruct plausible dialogues. Additionally, AI safety researchers might study how well the system maintains personas and where it fails, informing alignment strategies.
Entertainment/Outreach: A general audience might find value in a more narrative presentation – for instance, a podcast or audio dramatization could be generated from the simulation (text-to-speech voices of the scientists exist in archives, though using them would raise ethical issues). Alternatively, it could inspire historical fiction writers. The novelty of hearing famous scientists debate could draw interest to science history.
Each use case might require tweaking the approach: e.g., for a classroom, you might allow the user to pose questions to the panel (making it interactive, which adds complexity in handling arbitrary queries). For now, we focus on the self-contained simulation, but these possibilities show the project’s versatility.
Current Tools/Datasets to Leverage: We have already identified many. The Atomic Heritage Foundation’s oral histories​
ahf.nuclearmuseum.org
 are a ready dataset for training or fine-tuning dialogue style. The Voices of the Manhattan Project site even includes transcripts of interviews (some of which could be directly used as conversational fine-tuning examples). The Manhattan Project technical reports and memos available via OSTI and DOE can provide authentic technical language. On the AI side, libraries like LangChain, as noted, provide scaffolding for generative agents and memory​
python.langchain.com.cn
, saving us from writing that from scratch. There are also existing persona-based models: for instance, AI21 Labs had an experiment with an AI “philosopher” that might provide inspiration on parameter settings. And as referenced, apps like Hello History or Historical Figures Chat prove that the concept works at least on a superficial Q&A level – we can learn from their shortcomings (the need for better accuracy and moderation) as detailed in the Washington Post article​
washingtonpost.com
​
washingtonpost.com
. If the code or methodology of those apps were open, it could jumpstart our implementation (though likely they are proprietary). Nonetheless, research papers (like the AgentSociety arXiv paper) often share pseudocode or open-source code that we could adapt for large-scale agent simulation.
For visualization, tools like Gephi or Python’s NetworkX could help generate networks for development analysis before porting to a web UI.
For evaluation, datasets like TruthfulQA or others aren’t directly applicable, but we could use general QA pairs to test the model’s factual consistency on known questions (just to ensure the underlying LLM behaves before we unleash it in persona mode).
Open Problems and Next Steps: Despite careful planning, there are open challenges:
Hallucination vs. Creativity: We want agents to sometimes go beyond the exact historical record to create a lively discussion, but without introducing falsehoods. Tuning that “creativity dial” will be tricky. We might explore having the agents generate hypothetical scenarios (e.g., “what if Germany had gotten the bomb first?”) which could be insightful but then the conversation departs from actual history into alternate history. Is that within scope or a distraction? It might be fascinating but also complicates evaluation. Possibly, we keep initial simulations constrained, and later we could intentionally run an alternate-history scenario as a separate mode.
Emotional authenticity: While sentiment analysis can track mood, ensuring the conversation actually feels real to a reader is subjective. We might need to refine the style to include interjections, hesitations, or even miscommunications that real humans have. Pure LLM output can sometimes be too coherent or too quick to respond. Real meetings have pauses, misunderstandings, and clarifications. Simulating that could add realism (for instance, an agent might say “Let me rephrase” or “I’m not sure I understand your point, could you clarify?”). We can decide if we want that level of realism or if that would just add noise. It’s an open question and could be experimented with.
Scaling number of agents: We plan ~8-10, which is manageable. But what if we wanted to include many more minor voices (like technicians, military personnel, etc.)? AgentSociety and other work have scaled to hundreds of agents in simulation​
hai.stanford.edu
. We likely won’t go that far here, but it’s a future possibility (e.g., simulate a whole conference with dozens of attendees intervening). Each additional agent adds more complexity in managing turns and data, so it’s wise to perfect the smaller set first.
User Interaction: Currently the simulation is offline (agents talk to each other without external input after the initial prompt). A next step could be allowing a user or facilitator to ask questions in real-time. That introduces another dimension of complexity (the model would have to handle possibly unpredictable queries, and maintain persona under direct questioning). However, it would make it more interactive. This could be a stretch goal after the core system is stable.
Ethical Governance: Even though these figures are historical, we should consider an ethics board or at least peer review on using AI to “speak” for real people. Especially with the public release of such a system, we want to ensure it’s framed correctly and doesn’t spread misinformation. We may want to involve ethicists or communicators to formulate guidelines and messaging around the simulation. This is more of a project governance step than a technical one, but it’s important for real-world deployment.
Next Steps: In a practical timeline, after an MVP proves viable, next steps would include: (1) Expanding the number of agents and refining their training data and prompts, (2) implementing the memory mechanism for longer conversations, (3) developing the visualization and analysis tools alongside to continuously evaluate the runs, (4) iterating with expert feedback to improve historical alignment, and (5) preparing the system for a public or classroom pilot (which involves the content moderation and user interface polish). In conclusion, the project is ambitious but grounded in current capabilities. By starting with a focused prototype and gradually layering on complexity (more agents, longer runs, more features), we can manage risk and learn along the way. The availability of rich historical data and advanced AI models are key enablers – we are essentially standing on the shoulders of two giants: the intellectual legacy of the Manhattan Project participants, and the rapid progress in AI language modeling. The confluence of these domains offers a unique opportunity to explore “what might they have said to each other about the world they created?” in a way that is engaging and enlightening. With careful implementation and respect for accuracy, this simulation could serve as both a powerful educational tool and a demonstration of how AI can help us re-examine historical ethical debates in a new light.
