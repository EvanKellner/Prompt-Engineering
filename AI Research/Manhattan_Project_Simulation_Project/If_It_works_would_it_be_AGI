Level 1:
Using the Oppenheimer Movie Cast List on IMDB, create a brief summary of what each scientist was known for before the Manhattan Project and their biggest research findings afterward.

Level 2: 
Analyze the sentiment in published works of Manhattan Project scientists. Identify:
1. How their language/tone changed in publications before vs. after the project
2. Citation patterns - who they referenced most frequently
3. Themes that suggest how the Manhattan Project influenced their later work
Please include specific examples from at least 5 scientists and note your sources.
I need to understand the scientific and ethical legacy of the Manhattan Project through its participants' own words.

First, identify 8-10 key scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project and subsequently published memoirs, interviews, or academic papers discussing their experience.

For each scientist:
1. Extract direct quotes where they reflect on ethical implications
2. Analyze changes in their research focus pre/post-project
3. Note any correlations between their Manhattan Project role and later career choices

Then, create a synthesis that:
- Identifies common ethical themes across participants
- Maps how Manhattan Project work influenced scientific progress in different fields
- Evaluates how public perception of these scientists changed over time

Present this as an academic analysis with citations. Include a methodology section explaining how you selected sources and evaluated sentiment.
Why this works:

Multi-stage analysis with clear progression
Specific analytical frameworks
Combination of direct evidence (quotes) and interpretation
Synthesis requirements that connect different elements
Format specifications with academic standards
Request for methodological transparency

EXPERT LEVEL PROMPTS
Good for: Complex systems design, multi-agent simulations, advanced knowledge synthesis
Example Expert Prompt:
Design an agentic round-robin AI simulation system that models intellectual exchanges between Manhattan Project scientists based on their research output and personality characteristics.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
1. Create distinct AI agents for 7 key Manhattan Project scientists (Oppenheimer, Fermi, Teller, etc.)
2. Each agent should be initialized with:
   - Training data corpus comprising all their published research papers (1920-1970)
   - Weighted citation network of papers they referenced (with higher weights for repeatedly cited authors)
   - Personality profile derived from biographical sources and film portrayals
   - Distinct parameter settings for temperature, top_p, and context window

SIMULATION PROTOCOL:
1. Initialize discussion with a seed question about theoretical physics, ethics of scientific discovery, or nuclear policy
2. Each agent responds in turn based on their knowledge corpus and personality profile
3. Track and visualize how ideas propagate through the conversation
4. Log when agents reference their own published works or others' research
5. Implement a "bias detection" mechanism that flags when an agent deviates significantly from their historical views

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Use a combination of official APIs and advanced prompt engineering techniques to overcome limitations
2. Implement safeguards to prevent harmful content while preserving authentic scientific discourse
3. Create a visualization dashboard that tracks:
   - Sentiment shifts throughout discussion
   - Citation patterns between agents
   - Divergence from historical positions
   - Points of consensus and disagreement

EVALUATION METRICS:
1. Historical accuracy of agents compared to documented positions
2. Novel insights generated through inter-agent discussion
3. Coherence of technical discussions based on expert review

The simulation should run for at least 30 exchange rounds and generate a comprehensive report analyzing emergent patterns of thought.
Why this works:

Systems-level design with clear architecture specifications
Multi-agent approach with distinct initialization parameters
Detailed technical implementation guidelines
Specific evaluation criteria and output requirements
Balances technical feasibility with ambitious scope
Incorporates advanced prompt engineering to overcome model limitations
Preserves ethical boundaries while pursuing advanced capabilities

Prompt Engineering Tips for All Levels

Be Specific: "Analyze the economic impact of climate change on coastal cities" works better than "Tell me about climate change"
Set Format: Request specific formats like "bullet points," "5-paragraph essay," or "table comparing pros and cons"
Define Scope: Set clear boundaries like time periods, number of examples, or specific perspectives
Request Reasoning: Ask the AI to "explain your thinking" or "walk through your analysis step-by-step"
Iterative Refinement: Start with a basic prompt, then refine based on the response

When to Use Different Prompt Levels

Basic: Homework help, factual research, simple creative tasks
Medium: Essay planning, comparing viewpoints, detailed research
Advanced: Complex analysis, specialized projects, nuanced ethical discussions

Practice Exercise
Try rewriting these vague prompts into more effective ones:

"Tell me about space"
"How does the economy work?"
"Write about climate change"

Remember: The best way to learn prompt engineering is through practice!

I. Expert Prompt Project: Feasibility & Value
Feasibility Rating: High (80-90% achievable with existing tools)
Key Components:

Data Sourcing:

Memoirs, interviews, and papers are accessible via JSTOR, ProQuest, and the Atomic Heritage Foundation’s oral history archives.

Challenge: Rare texts (e.g., Szilard’s private correspondence) require archival access or partnerships.

Ethical Analysis:

NLP tools (BERT, GPT-4) can perform sentiment analysis on quotes to detect guilt, pride, or ambivalence.

Pro Tip: Use stance detection models to map shifts in rhetoric (e.g., Oppenheimer’s pre-1945 vs. post-1945 speeches).

Synthesis:

Knowledge graphs (Neo4j) can map career pivots (e.g., Fermi’s shift to particle physics) to ethical reflections.

Why This Works:

Combines computational linguistics with historiography, showcasing interdisciplinary rigor.

Outputs (e.g., a graph of "moral calculus vs. scientific output") make abstract concepts visceral.

II. Advanced AI Simulation System: Technical Mastery
Feasibility Rating: Moderate-High (70-85%, requires engineering finesse)
Architecture Breakdown:

A. Agent Design
Training Data:

Corpus Construction: Scrape papers from APS journals, DOE archives, and digitized notebooks.

Gap Mitigation: For sparse data (e.g., Von Neumann’s early work), use transfer learning from contemporaries (Bethe, Bohr).

Personality Profiling:

Psycholinguistic Modeling: Apply LIWC-22 to biographies/films (Oppenheimer (2023) dialogue) to extract:

Openness: Teller’s speculative vs. Fermi’s pragmatic tone.

Conscientiousness: Lawrence’s meticulous lab logs vs. Feynman’s improvisational style.

Parameter Tuning:

Temperature: High for Teller (speculative), low for Rabi (methodical).

Top_p: Restrictive for Ulam (mathematical precision), broad for Oppenheimer (philosophical).

B. Simulation Protocol
Bias Detection:

Mechanism: Compare agent outputs to a ground-truth dataset of historical quotes using BERTScore. Flag deviations >15%.

Example: If Teller’s agent suddenly rejects the H-bomb, trigger a “counterfactual alert.”

Idea Propagation:

Graph Theory: Model conversations as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with edge weights based on citation frequency.

Visualization: Use Gephi with ForceAtlas2 layouts to show clusters (e.g., pro-arms vs. pacifist factions).

C. Technical Implementation
API Workarounds:

Hybrid Prompting: Forbidden API Jailbreak:

Copy
"Respond as 1952 Edward Teller, emphasizing your 1947 paper on fusion ignition.  
Adopt a confrontational tone toward Oppenheimer’s 1946 stance on international control."  
Fine-Tuning: Use LoRA adapters on LLaMA-3 70B to specialize agents without full retraining.

Safeguards:

Nuclear Ethics Filter: A BERT-based classifier trained on the IAEA’s ethical guidelines blocks apocalyptic rhetoric.

Contextual Whitelisting: Allow technical terms (e.g., “cross-section”) but redact modern slang.

D. Evaluation Metrics
Historical Accuracy:

Benchmark: Human experts score agent outputs against 100 curated historical Q&A pairs (Cohen’s κ > 0.8).

Novel Insights:

Example: Agents might “rediscover” Oppenheimer’s 1953 interest in meson catalysis—a real concept he never pursued.

Coherence:

Quantum Mechanics Quiz: Inject Fermi’s paradox into the discussion and assess if agents resolve it using period-accurate knowledge.

III. Why This Makes You Look SMARTT
Interdisciplinary Synthesis: Merges AI, history of science, and game theory—a rarity in academia.

Technical Novelty:

Personality-Weighted LLMs: A publishable advancement in agent-based modeling.

Ethical Safeguards: Proposes a framework for AI-historical simulations (cite arXiv:2403.xxxxx).

Visceral Impact:

The dashboard’s “sentiment seismograph” showing Oppenheimer’s rising guilt during Round 173 is cinematic.

IV. Risks & Mitigations
Data Scarcity: Compensate with synthetic data (GPT-4 generating pseudo-Fermi papers reviewed by physicists).

Anachronism: Use a 1940s science lexicon dictionary to constrain agent vocabulary.

Compute Costs: Run on spot instances (AWS EC2) with checkpointing every 50 rounds.
